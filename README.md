## Prerequisites

### Understanding AWS
**Amazon Web Services (AWS):**
- AWS offers cloud computing services that provide scalable resources like virtual servers, storage, and networking.

**EC2 Instances:**
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances are virtual servers that can run various applications, including game servers. Understanding instance types and configurations is key.

**AMIs (Amazon Machine Images):**
- AMIs are pre-configured templates used to create instances. They include the operating system and optional software packages.

### Basics of Windows Server
**Windows Server Overview:**
- Windows Server is a Microsoft operating system designed for servers. It includes features for managing networked resources, user accounts, and server applications.

**File System and Navigation:**
- Use Windows Explorer to manage files and directories. Familiarize yourself with basic operations like copying, moving, and deleting files.

**Network Configuration:**
- Configure network settings such as IP addresses, DNS, and firewall rules to ensure proper server functionality and accessibility.

### Basics of Counter-Strike 1.6
**Game Server Basics:**
- The CS 1.6 server manages game sessions, player connections, and game rules. Key files include `server.cfg` for server settings and `autoexec.cfg` for automatic configurations.

**Command-Line Arguments:**
- Customize server startup options with command-line arguments. Examples include specifying game mode or map.

**Server Commands:**
- In-game commands help manage the server and interact with players. Learn common commands for effective server administration.
